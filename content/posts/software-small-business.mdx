I believe some small business fall behind because they lack certain resources that giant corporations have. 

I also believe that some of those resources is software. Such software to manage inventory, software to analyze sales (especially for brick and mortar), and just software that is cheaper to use for transactions. 

There needs to be more open source of these tools to help level the playing field or at least help them catch up.
