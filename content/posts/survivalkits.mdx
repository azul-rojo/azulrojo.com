# Survival Kits Project

***

An attempt to design a collection of resources to create survival kits for people that need it. It is meant for anyone that can help that have the resources to share these kits out or simply inform of these kits. 

The design is meant to be simple since creating a kit is just a list. We also want to provide resources that serves the same purpose as to encourage others to create these kits. The task is to create an informational website. 

Using react, mainly cause it’s what I like to use. We can create this simple design. We host everything on GitHub because it allows us to keep the project open for anyone to contribute or make suggestions. GitHub also provides free hosting for our website. 

There isn’t tangible results now. The point of the website is to bring awareness. We do have google analytics set up. The next steps after this is to promote the site. My strategy for this is to keep on building more interesting stuff for our community and hopefully bring in traffic that way while also encouraging others to help contribute.
