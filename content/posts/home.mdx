# Azul Rojo

***

## Situation

There is so many ways to help uplift our communities. But there’s no better advice on how to start than just start. It’s not a bad idea but we can do better.

## Task

We want to build tools, templates, and ways others can improve on the processes that help our communities. We want our projects to be able to scale and be repeatable so others can do them too.

## Action

The project starts with creating this website that is the home of collection of projects (which anyone can contribute). The next steps is starting. But at the same time we want to take note of how we actually started. Think of it as a beginner mindset. We want to know how we started, what challenges we faced, what is easy, everything as much as we can. It is almost scientific we want to gather data from our projects to see how we can improve it, how well it worked, how we predict it will scale.

## Result

We expect to have collaboration and figure out common themes. Maybe we can go as far as build tools to improve our own collaboration process. Kinda meta work, important work. Our end goal will be to uplift as we climb. We haven’t made it until we all made it.
