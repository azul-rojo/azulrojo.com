# Checklist

***

On my quest to figuring out how to travel with DACA I found the best way to organize myself and the things I need is through a checklist. I found different sources online that laid out a list of paper work we need to get started. Of course these are handy but I also would have like to keep track of those documents I have and don't have. I mean this project is over kill but the idea is that the inspiration comes from using tech to handle managing those checklist items.

This is just a list app that is nice looking (according to myself). Using modern tools (instead of paper and pencils) like React.js and Supabase.
