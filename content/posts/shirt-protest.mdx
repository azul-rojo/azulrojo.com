# Shirt Protesting

***

Printing on a shirt to share your thoughts is a great way to protest and spread a message. Brands do it all the time. We basically become their free advertising. So the thought is to create cool designs to entice people to create and wear what they are thinking. It can be political or not. 

First we gotta start with a design. It might be hard to create one if you aren’t the most creative but i believe everyone is, we just gotta look for what inspires us. For example if we look at some of our favorite brands like vans with their graffic tees, they can be complex or just simply text. 

After we have our design we gotta print it on a shirt. There’s different approaches. The easiest can be to look for local shops that do the printing for you. Luckily in nyc there’s some that are accessible by a train ride. Alternatively we can print it ourselves. We can always draw it ourselves or we can gather tools that will help us print.
